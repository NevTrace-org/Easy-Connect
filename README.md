# EASY CONNECT


## 1. Project overview

Easy Connect is a solution that provides quick and easy access to any Qubic smart contract data, enabling applications and developers to leverage the full potential of this network into their business logic, without the need for them to implement any technical integration with the Qubic network.

In addition to providing quick integration for any application or service, Easy Connect provides components for integrating Qubic into no-code platforms like Make or Zappier, allowing millions of users inmediate access to Qubic without requiring technical knowledge.


## 2. Scope of the proposal

Our proposal for joining the Qubic incubation program is to create an initial version of Easy Connect that will monitor every information related to the main smart contracts already deployed into Qubic, allowing any application or service to subscribe and receive in real time every data generated on the network, via webhooks.

This first Easy Connect version will also offer a web-based configuration panel where users can select the smart contracts they want to monitor and the information they want to receive, as well as the endpoint to which our platform will send the data in real time.

In addition, the scope of the proposal includes the creation of a first version of Easy Connect component for Make that will allow any user, without technical knowledge, to integrate existing information on Qubic into any application and process, thanks to the more than 1,600 applications compatible with this leading no-code platform.

## 5. Monetization

Freemium to scale. Premium to grow.

Easy Connect's business model will be based on two distinct customer segments:

### Qubic ecosystem

The target audience is developers, projects, and users of the Qubic ecosystem who want to easily and quickly integrate existing information into the network, obtained in real time.

- Free tier: Monitoring of existing information in a single Qubic smart contract in real time, with limitations on the volume of information and refresh time.
- Premium tier: Full access to the main Qubic smart contracts, parameterization through a user dashboard, receipt of real-time information, and priority support, through a monthly subscription (paid in QUBIC).

### No-code platforms

Easy Connect Qubic modules for the main no-code platforms (Make, Zappier, etc.), offering two modalities:
- **Free tier**: 1,000 ops/mo, 1 active scenario, 15-minute interval.
- **Premium tier**: Extended usage, advanced features, and priority support.

### Early adoption incentives 
 
- **Discounts**: Reduced pricing for early users.  
- **Testimonial rewards**: Benefits for users sharing case studies.  
- **Roadmap influence**: Premium users can vote on feature prioritization.


## 6. Marketing and Communication strategy

## 10. Conclusion

At [NevTrace](https://nevtrace.com) we've been working for a decade to become **the link between the real world and the on-chain ecosystem**.

Our mission is to help companies that want to take advantage of the opportunities offered by blockchain, and on-chain projects that need to go beyond early adopters.

The Easy Connect proposal we're presenting aligns perfectly with our vision and addresses a real need in the Qubic ecosystem to drive its growth both within the current ecosystem and beyond, toward the early majority.

We're confident that the proposal will be interesting for Qubic ecosystem,and that we can develop an initial commercial version of Easy Connect thanks to the Qubic Incubation Program.

Furthermore, we confirm our willingness to maintain and evolve the Easy Connect solution beyond the scope defined in this document, in case we receive the necessary funding through Qubic's grant programs or other funding alternatives.
