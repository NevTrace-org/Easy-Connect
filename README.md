# Easy Connect - Qubic

## 1. Project Overview

Easy Connect is a solution that provides quick and easy access to any Qubic smart contract data, enabling applications and developers to leverage the full potential of this network into their business logic, without the need for them to implement any technical integration with the Qubic network.

In addition to providing quick integration for any application or service, Easy Connect provides components for integrating Qubic into no-code platforms like Make or Zappier, allowing millions of users inmediate access to Qubic without requiring technical knowledge.

## 2. Scope of the Proposal

We will develop an initial commercial version of Easy Connect that will allow monitoring information related to the main smart contracts of the Qubic network, allowing any application or service to subscribe to receive data generated on the network in real time via webhooks.

Easy Connect will also offer a web-based configuration panel where users can select the smart contracts they wish to monitor and the information they wish to obtain, as well as the endpoint to which our platform will send the obtained data in real time.

In addition, the scope of the proposal includes the creation of a Make component that will allow any user, without technical knowledge, to integrate existing information on Qubic with any application and process, thanks to the more than 1,600 applications compatible with this no-code platform.
