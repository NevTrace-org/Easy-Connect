# EASY CONNECT

![Easy Connect logo](easyconnect.jpg)

## 1. Project overview

Easy Connect is a solution that provides quick and easy access to any Qubic smart contract data, enabling applications and developers to leverage the full potential of this network into their business logic, without the need for them to implement any technical integration with the Qubic network.

In addition to providing quick integration for any application or service, Easy Connect provides components for integrating Qubic into no-code platforms like Make or Zappier, allowing millions of users inmediate access to Qubic without requiring technical knowledge.


## 2. Scope of the proposal

Our proposal for joining the Qubic incubation program is to create an initial version of Easy Connect that will monitor every information related to the main smart contracts already deployed into Qubic, allowing any application or service to subscribe and receive in real time every data generated on the network, via webhooks.

This first Easy Connect version will also offer a web-based configuration panel where users can select the smart contracts they want to monitor and the information they want to receive, as well as the endpoint to which our platform will send the data in real time.

In addition, the scope of the proposal includes the creation of a first version of Easy Connect component for Make that will allow any user, without technical knowledge, to integrate existing information on Qubic into any application and process, thanks to the more than 1,600 applications compatible with this leading no-code platform.

## 5. Monetization

Our strategy: **Freemium to scale. Premium to grow.**

Easy Connect's business model will be based on two distinct customer segments:

### Qubic ecosystem

The target audience is developers and users of the Qubic ecosystem who want to easily and quickly integrate real time data into their projects.

- **Free tier**: Monitoring of existing information in a single Qubic smart contract, with limited performance and basic support.
- **Premium tier**: Full access to the main Qubic smart contracts, parameterization through a user dashboard, receipt of real-time information and having premium support, through a monthly subscription (paid in QUBIC).

### No-code platforms

Easy Connect Qubic modules for the main no-code platforms (Make, Zappier, etc.), offering two modalities:
- **Free tier**: 1,000 ops/mo, 1 active scenario, 15-minute interval.
- **Premium tier**: Extended usage, advanced features, and premium support.

### Early adoption incentives 

During the final phase of the project, we will launch campaigns aimed at attracting early users, incentivizing them through discounts and promotions, to scale faster after the launch and obtain promoters that will allow us to attract more users.
 
- **Discounts**: Reduced pricing for early users.  
- **Testimonial rewards**: Benefits for users sharing case studies.  
- **Roadmap influence**: Premium early users can vote on feature prioritization.


## 6. Marketing and communication strategy

### Current market landscape  

The market is primed for such solutions. Existing integrations between blockchain and automation tools have demonstrated tangible value. Some examples:  
- **Quant Network**, which introduced a Zapier integration enabling no-code connections between blockchain networks and legacy systems.  
- **mintBlue**, a platform linking over 3,000 applications to public blockchains.

### Value proposition  

Position **Easy Connect as "the bridge between two worlds"**, the intricate blockchain ecosystem and the user-friendly automation tools businesses already rely on.

Core messaging will emphasize:  
- **Democratization**: "Qubic for everyone, no coding required."  
- **Simplicity**: "Transform weeks of development into minutes of configuration."  
- **Trust**: "Deliver trustworthy Qubic data to business processes." 

### Audience targeting

We will focus on three different buyer persona:
- **Qubic ecosystem**: Existing applications and services who want to obtain data in real time for monitoring, reporting, user support...
- **No-code/low-code developers**: Current users of Make/Zapier looking to expand their automation capabilities including Qubic data.  
- **Web3 startups and blockchain firms**: Requiring seamless integration with Qubic network.  

### Content strategy  

**Content pillars**  
- **Educational resources**: Pushing Qubic’s relevance across industries.
- **Use cases**: Practical examples of Qubic-Make/Zapier integrations.  
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for implementing workflows.  
- **Trend insights**: Analyses of Qubic and automation’s evolving landscape.  

**Content formats**  
- **Social networks**: Technical deep dives in X and Farcaster, business-centric articles in LinkedIn.   
- **Webinars**: Live demonstrations and Q&A sessions in X and LinkedIn.  
- **Infographics**: Visual breakdowns of complex processes.  
- **Video tutorials**: Walkthroughs of common integration scenarios.  

### Social media strategy  

Since we won second prize at [MAD Hack 2025](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/qubic-vottun-2025-madrid-hackathon-recap) we have started a social media positioning strategy, which will be increased during the development of the project to achieve community engagement and capture potential leads, as well as Easy Connect promoters.

We will focus on X and Farcaster, where the communities interested in Blockchain and Web3 are currently located, to capture potential leads and generate engagement.

In parallel, we will use LinkedIn to reach companies and professionals interested in automation and the Blockchain applications they can integrate into their businesses.

## 10. Conclusion

At NevTrace we've been working for a decade to **become the link between the real world and the on-chain ecosystem**.

Our mission is to help companies that want to take advantage of the opportunities offered by blockchain **and on-chain projects that need to go beyond early adopters**.

The Easy Connect proposal we're presenting **aligns perfectly with our vision and addresses a real need in the Qubic ecosystem** to drive its growth both within the current ecosystem and beyond, toward the early majority.

**We're confident that the proposal will be interesting for Qubic**, and that we can develop an initial commercial version of Easy Connect thanks to the Qubic Incubation Program.

Furthermore, **we confirm our willingness to maintain and evolve the Easy Connect solution** beyond the scope defined in this proposal, **in case we receive the necessary funding** through Qubic's grant programs or other funding alternatives.
