# Easy Connect - Qubic

## 1. Project Overview

Easy Connect is a solution that provides quick and easy access to any Qubic smart contract data, enabling applications and developers to leverage the full potential of this network into their business logic, without the need for them to implement any technical integration with the Qubic network.

In addition to providing quick integration for any application or service, Easy Connect provides components for integrating Qubic into no-code platforms like Make or Zappier, allowing millions of users inmediate access to Qubic without requiring technical knowledge.

## 2. Scope of the Proposal

Our proposal for joining the Qubic incubation program is to create an initial version of Easy Connect that will monitor every information related to the main smart contracts already deployed into Qubic, allowing any application or service to subscribe and receive in real time every data generated on the network, via webhooks.

This first Easy Connect version will also offer a web-based configuration panel where users can select the smart contracts they want to monitor and the information they want to receive, as well as the endpoint to which our platform will send the data in real time.

In addition, the scope of the proposal includes the creation of a first version of Easy Connect component for Make that will allow any user, without technical knowledge, to integrate existing information on Qubic into any application and process, thanks to the more than 1,600 applications compatible with this leading no-code platform.

## 5. Marketing and Communication strategy

### Current Market Landscape  
The market is primed for such solutions. Existing integrations between blockchain and automation tools have demonstrated tangible value, exemplified by:  
- **Quant Network**, which introduced a Zapier integration enabling no-code connections between blockchain networks and legacy systems.  
- **mintBlue**, a platform linking over 3,000 applications to public blockchains.

### Unique Value Proposition

## 9. Conclusion

At [NevTrace](https://nevtrace.com) we've been working for a decade to become **the link between the real world and the on-chain ecosystem**.

Our mission is to help companies that want to take advantage of the opportunities offered by blockchain, and on-chain projects that need to go beyond early adopters.

The Easy Connect proposal we're presenting aligns perfectly with our vision and addresses a real need in the Qubic ecosystem to drive its growth both within the current ecosystem and beyond, toward the early majority.

We're confident that the proposal will be interesting and that we can develop an initial commercial version of Easy Connect.
