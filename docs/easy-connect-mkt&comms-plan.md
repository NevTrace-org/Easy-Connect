- **No-code/low-code developers**: Current users of Make/Zapier looking to expand their automation capabilities including Qubic data.
- **Web3 startups and blockchain firms**: Requiring seamless integration with Qubic network.

### Content strategy

### Social media strategy

Since MAD Hack 2025 we have started a social media positioning strategy, which will be increased during the development of the project to achieve community engagement and capture potential leads, as well as Easy Connect promoters.

We will focus on X mainly (starting also Qubic community in Farcaster) since it is where the communities interested in Blockchain and Web3 are currently located, to capture potential leads and generate engagement.

In parallel, we will use LinkedIn to reach companies and professionals interested in automation and the Blockchain applications they can integrate into their businesses.
